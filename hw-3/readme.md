[ My Working "Hello World!" Sketch](https://ashtonmwilson.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

Week 3 Response:
--
This week I did homework consisting of learning the basice of the p5js entry code, including the functions for creating a canvas, text, background, elipse, including some color and size specifications. I am getting caught up and have a couple questions I am excited to engage with the class on in the coming week. I am enrolled in both webdesign classes and am wondering if I am going to have to re link my "live" page to each repo as home work comes due, and if that will impact others ability to access my work. Moving forward I hope I can also be a resource to others in need, as I feel that I am digesting the content decently.
<br/>
I also learned a bit about the src tags within the index.html document and their role when incorporating p5.js. 



Final Thoughts
--
I was really fired up by the interactive video at the [p5js website](http://hello.p5js.org/) And I am excited to learn some of those techniques.
<br/> I was also thankfull for the comments steering me away from writing this README as a response to questions as it was a bit stale.
