Animating with Math:
--

This week I learned about setting up, naming, and using variables to simplify code. I learned how to use the mouse position to direct what is happening on screen. I also learned about frame rate and how to adjust it. We dug a little deeper into what clean code looks like and what the different statements mean in terms of how they communicate the code to be processed.

I started this weeks homework assignment by thinking about how I could draw up a drone in p5.js whose propellors whould spin opposite eachother. I first created the propellors and worked through animating them based on the mouses position. I encountered a handfull of issues, most of which were in the syntax of my code. I often forgot to close the push() with a pop() which made for some fascnating variations of rotation at one point. I also found that the "rotation" command needed to be positioned above the shape in order to function properly.

I would love to go back and do this assignment again, and steer towards the creative art side, maybe having all my little propellors repeat themselves, without a body, and add color and opacity to just make something beautiful.
