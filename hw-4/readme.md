Wow, solidly behind, and working hard to catch up.
These last weeks I have been working hard to absorb the basic information about new code in p5.js and learned some of the 2d primitives. I played with a handfull of them and I hope to use more of them. I got a little caught up having higher expectations for my self. I did find a handfull of really cool tools I will share in the forum, which looks a little dead, unless I have just not seen issues that have closed. I struggle with math, and was challenged to visualise the benifits of the "translate" feature. I used it to the best of my ability.



Final Thoughts

I am excited for some more advanced visual and interactive properties.
